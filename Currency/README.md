## Currency

What is Currency?

I made a Currency plugin that can convert any choosen currency.

What you need for this plugin to work:

1: An API from https://www.exchangerate-api.com

What now?

You now have to add the plugin into your plugin directory

Then reload the plugin
`+reload currency`

Then:
`+supybot.plugins.Currency.apiKey <your_api_key_here>`

And you should be good to go!
