## WordCounter

I made this plugin as a fun thing. All it does it's counts lines and words in channels that is defined in the script


# Commands

`+stats - Shows the stats in the channel you are in`

`+stats 2025-07 uses current channel you are in`

`+stats #CHAN - Shows the stats from a giving channel`

`+stats #CHAN 2025-07 - shows stats #CHAN YYY-MMM`

# Output

```
