## Kudos

What is Kudos?

Kudos is used to award positive and negative kudo points to users in a channel. e.g. bob++ will award a positive point to bob, and -- a negative point. More than one point may be
awarded by using, for example, bob+++ or bob+=2, however, this is limited by your current level of kudos (positive-negative kudos); 1 additional point for every 50 kudo points you
have (max 3). You can also rate
